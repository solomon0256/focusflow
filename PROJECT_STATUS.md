# FocusFlow Project Status & PhD-Strategic Manifest

**Strategic Note:** The project is pivoting to an **"iOS-First, Academic-Heavy"** roadmap to ensure the creator can maximize PhD application impact while maintaining commercial viability.

---

## 1. ✅ Completed Modules

*   **Core HUD & AI Loop**: MediaPipe Pose detection is stable at 2-5 FPS (Eco Mode).
*   **State Machine**: 4-level focus state (Deep Flow, Focused, Wandering, Distracted).
*   **I18n**: Support for 11 languages including Optimized Simplified Chinese.
*   **SaaS Layer**: IAP Pricing logic defined.

---

## 2. 🚨 Critical Next Steps (PhD Impact Mode)

### A. Technical Achievement (Academic Flex)
*   **WASM Optimization**: Further reduce the `.task` model size or implement multi-threading to move AI off the main UI thread.
*   **HCI Analytics**: Implement a system to track "Recovery Time" (how fast a user returns to focus after an alert) as a key scientific metric.

### B. Distribution (China Market)
*   **iOS Global Submission**: Prepare the bundle for App Store Connect.
*   **Mainland Compliance**: Research "Software Copyright" agencies for early application (takes ~30 days).

## 3. 🎯 Objective Success Probability Evaluation

*   **Academic Impact**: 9/10 (Excellent for HCI/AI PhD CVs).
*   **Market Differentiation**: 8.5/10 (AI Posture is a rare feature in Pomodoro apps).
*   **User Retention**: 7/10 (Strongly dependent on the **Pet/Fox System**).
*   **Ease of Launch**: 5/10 (Mainland China Android stores are a significant time sink).
